# Just discovered tmux plugins

As always in my carrer i've been pushed by the needs to solve and specific problem, this time i was just about to upgrade my Fedora 29 to Fedora 30, i'm already late! Then i was to reboot and proceed and then accounted my tmux list-sessions to try to recover them later on. Then it came to me the idea that there should be a sort of "restore my session" support for tmux, and as almost always happens with FOSS,  we have a solution and searching the net the way to go.

If you are new to tmux plugins, as i am, start by reviewing your tmux version. This is what i get from my F29 installation.

{% highlight shell %}
~(gomix) tmux -V
tmux 2.9a

~(gomix) rpm -qi tmux

Summary     : A terminal multiplexer
Description :
tmux is a "terminal multiplexer."  It enables a number of terminals (or
windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal.  tmux is
intended to be a simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such

{% endhighlight %}

As i can verify from tmux main site at github, we have in F29 a very recent version. Also, before trying to install from other methods, i made a search on dnf repos:

{% highlight shell %}
~(gomix) dnf search tmux
...
======================================= Name Exactly Matched: tmux =======================================
tmux.x86_64 : A terminal multiplexer
====================================== Name & Summary Matched: tmux ======================================
tmux-powerline.noarch : Powerline for tmux
python2-libtmux.noarch : Scripting library for tmux
python3-libtmux.noarch : Scripting library for tmux
tmuxinator-doc.noarch : Documentation for tmuxinator
tmuxinator.noarch : Create and manage complex tmux sessions easily
tmux-top.x86_64 : Monitoring information for your tmux status line.
{% endhighlight %}

We don't really have a first support for tmux plugins from Fedora packages, perhaps you can start packaging some to get involved in Fedora.

Moving on into my cruise to F29 -> F30 upgrade and "restore my sessions in tmux", the tmux plugins needed to solve the problem are:

* [tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect)
* [tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum)

So, i need to install them, how? We know already know we can't from Fedora official repos, what about third party repos? After a quick search on third party common dnf/yum repos, i don't find any, so i move forward with [Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) instructions.

{% highlight shell %}
~(gomix) git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

{% endhighlight %}

My ~/.tmux.conf added lines:

{% highlight shell %}
...
# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'

# Other examples:
# set -g @plugin 'github_username/plugin_name'
# set -g @plugin 'git@github.com/user/plugin'
# set -g @plugin 'git@bitbucket.com/user/plugin'

# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
run -b '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
{% endhighlight %}

Since tmux is running, i do have to reload the configuration:

{% highlight shell %}
~(gomix) tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
{% endhighlight %}

## Installing plugins with tpm
    
Add new plugin to ~/.tmux.conf with set -g @plugin '...'

{% highlight shell %}
...
# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'
{% endhighlight %}

Press prefix + I (capital i, as in Install) to fetch the plugins in a tmux session. You can see the sources are installed looking at your configured tmux plugins directory:

{% highlight shell %}
~(gomix) ls ~/.tmux/plugins/ 
tmux-continuum  tmux-resurrect  tmux-sensible  tpm
{% endhighlight %}

Final setup just needs another configuration line added:

{% highlight shell %}
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
{% endhighlight %}

## Usage

With this configuration, thereâ€™s no need to do anything manually. Your tmux sessions will be automatically saved every 15 minutes and automatically restored when tmux is started (e.g. after a reboot). You can manually save with prefix-Ctrl-s and manually restore with prefix-Ctrl-r if desired.
