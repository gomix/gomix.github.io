Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:

I am interested in improving the situation of the people in my country, Venezuela. I am currently self employed and i consider myself very fortunate. I believe my skills and experiences i have gained in my carrer make me an ideal candidate to keep working hard for our country.

What we need is your investment, we, venezueleans, have the talent and human power and will to do the job well done.

I am confident that my experience as FOSS advocate, as sysadmin, devop and web developer as well as a tech writer, can help our nation general situation. If you would like, I can provide you with current samples of my work. 

I have a decent resume somewhere in this website (working on it). I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.

Sincerely,

Guillermo GÃ³mez Savino
